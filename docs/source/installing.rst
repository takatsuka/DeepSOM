Installing
======================

There are two main methods to get the Deep SOM Library up and running on your
system.

Installation
------------------------------------

First, visit the code repository at ``https://bitbucket.org/ChristopherIrving/deep-som-dome``
and clone it.

You will need to install the dependencies for both the PySOM Creator 
visualisation application and the Deep SOM Library itself if you intend to use
both. Otherwise follow the respective subheadings below.
