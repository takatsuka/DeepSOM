PySOM Creator and Library Documentation Homepage
================================================

PySOM is a Deep `SOM`_ high performance Python library intended for machine
learning researchers to quickly develop and test deep SOM networks. The library
is also bundled with a frontend application called PySOM Creator which leverages
the library API to help configure and visualise deep SOM networks and any
related outputs.
