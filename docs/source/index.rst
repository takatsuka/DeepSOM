Deep SOM Library Documentation Homepage
============================================

The Deep `SOM`_ Library is a high performance Python library intended for machine
learning researchers to quickly develop and test deep SOM networks. The library
is also bundled with a frontend application called PySOM Creator which leverages
the library API to help configure and visualise deep SOM networks and any
related outputs.
